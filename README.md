## Content View
The ContentView file serves as the central component of the app, orchestrating the
interaction between various SwiftUI structs. It showcases the app's functionality
and demonstrates the implementation of methods and properties. Within this file,
the deck of flashcards is created and animated, offering users an engaging learning
experience.

## Card View
The CardView file facilitates the reusability of the Card struct, allowing for the
design and customization of individual flashcards. Here, the properties and
appearance of each card are defined, contributing to the overall user interface of
the app. Additionally, the initial deck of cards is declared within this file,
providing users with a starting point for their study sessions.

## Create Flashcard View
The CreateFlashcardView file enables users to create new flashcards by inputting
their desired questions and answers. This feature enhances the app's functionality
by allowing users to tailor their study materials to their specific learning needs.
